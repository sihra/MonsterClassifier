                The server side was built with Node.js, Express, and React.js. The machine learning model was built using <a href="https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html">Fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning For Coders</a> Lesson 1.
                I've followed along with the classes by creating <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gsihra">Kaggle Notebooks</a> to work with the Fast.ai library.

                Monster Classifier uses Fast.ai's resnet18 neural network model which is integrated with a large collection of data vison models in the world (at the time). This makes it a great pick because it's a general model and can handle a variety of data.


                I created a <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/data.block.html#datablock">DataBlock</a> which inputs data into this model and outlines the type of data we're expecting back (categories).

                A <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/vision.learner.html">Vision Learner</a> was used to combine the model and data that I used to train it with. Then by using the <a href="which deploys my model and returns the probability of the image uploaded being a monster!">predict method</a>, MonsterClassifier is able to return the probability of the image uploaded being a monster!

              <p>Overall, this lesson helped me understand how to use Fast.ai's tool to use and train a model, but a lot of my knowledge behind how it was created and fine tuned is fuzzy.
                As I continue with the course I believe I'll understand the fundamental better.
                The documentation is bare bones but I found a lot of help through the forums.
